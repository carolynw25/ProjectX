# ProjectX
CSG4144 (Introduction to Bioinformatic Algorithms) Project to analyze expression data  
Team Members (Team 4): Kushal Gaddam, Akhilesh Makam, Carolyn Wang, Devin Wylde  
  
  
For this project we will be using a dataset from refine.bio #ERP109789 called "RNA-seq of human neurons derived from H9 embryonic stem cell lines treated with BDNF, TrkB agonist ZEB 85 or NT4 against untreated controls".  
Link to dataset: https://www.refine.bio/experiments/ERP109789/rna-seq-of-human-neurons-derived-from-h9-embryonic-stem-cell-lines-treated-with-bdnf-trkb-agonist-zeb-85-or-nt4-against-untreated-controls  
  
Scientific Question: Over the course of four time stamps, between the treatments BNDF, TrkB agonist ZEB85, and the related factor neurotrophin-4 (NT4), how do the different treatments affect the gene expression of the H9 embryonic stem cells in comparison to the control group?
