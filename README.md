# ProjectX
CSG4144 (Introduction to Bioinformatic Algorithms) Project to analyze expression data
Team Members: Kushal Gaddam, Akhilesh Makam, Carolyn Wang, Devin Wylde


For this project we will be using a dataset from refine.bio #ERP109789 called "RNA-seq of human neurons derived from H9 embryonic stem cell lines treated with BDNF, TrkB agonist ZEB 85 or NT4 against untreated controls".
